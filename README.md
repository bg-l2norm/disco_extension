# Disco Extension

A user-friendly wrapper for Google DeepMind's [Disco RL](https://github.com/google-deepmind/disco_rl). This library simplifies the process of running meta-training and standard reinforcement learning evaluations by encapsulating complex JAX/Haiku logic into easy-to-use functions.

## Installation

You need to install the base library and this extension:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/google-deepmind/disco_rl.git
pip install git+https://github.com/bg-l2norm/disco_extension.git
